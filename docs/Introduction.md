## What is a parametric map

In clinical MRI we can acquire series of images with different acquisition settings or in a different physiological states. The changes observed on the images correspond to change of certain physical or physiological parameters. If the model of this change is known, a mathematical procedure called fitting can be performed to extract the parameters from the data. If this procedure is performed in every

 If the settings are adjusted to observe changes corresponding to certain

> To generate a parametric map of perfusion or relaxation times, multiple images of the same region of the myocardium are acquired with different sensitivity to the parameter of interest, and the signal intensities of these images are fit to a model that describes the underlying physiology or relaxation parameters. The parametric map is an image of the fitted perfusion parameters or relaxation times.
