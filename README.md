# Welcome to Tomato Docs

TOMATO (Total Mapping Toolbox) is a C++ library for the calculation of parametric maps in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As an open source project, TOMATO allows transparent and standardized cardiac longitudinal relaxation time (T1) mapping in clinical applications. With C++ implementation, TOMATO can easily interface and translate between research software environments, and commercial vendors‚Äô closed-source C++ environments on scanners as well as post-processing software. To complement the core library implementation, a ready-to-use command line tool has been provided.
